    計算教友聲名性
    Computed props are more declarative than watched properties<br>
    計算 較純粹:回傳值 同步 無副作用(如異步請求 更改DOM)
    Computed props should be pure: return a value, synchronous, and have no side-effects<br>
    計算確實產生(屬性)監聽則指呼叫函式
    Computed props create new reactive properties, watched props only call functions<br>
    計算可受多屬性影像(多對一)監聽可影響多屬性(一對多)
    Computed props can react to changes in multiple props, whereas watched props can only watch one at a time<br>
    經過計算得到的屬性值，它們會被緩存 只在需要時才會被重新計算，監聽屬性發生改變時立即執行相應的函數
    Computed props are cached, so they only recalculate when things change. Watched props are executed every time<br>
    同上Computed props are evaluated lazily, meaning they are only executed when they are needed to be used. Watched props
    are executed whenever a prop changes<br><br>
    Watch is for side effects. If you need to change state you want to use a computed prop instead.<br>
    Most of the time you'll want a computed prop, so try to use that first.<br>
